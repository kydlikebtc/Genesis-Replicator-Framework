# Genesis Replicator Framework

A comprehensive framework for developing autonomous AI agents in Web3 environments, featuring advanced blockchain integration, scalable architecture, and intelligent decision-making capabilities.

## Overview

Genesis Replicator Framework provides a robust foundation for building, deploying, and managing autonomous AI agents that can interact with blockchain networks and Web3 services. The framework implements:

- **Advanced Event System** with priority queues and retry mechanisms
- **Multi-chain Blockchain Integration** with comprehensive security measures
- **Intelligent Decision Engine** powered by configurable AI models
- **Scalable Architecture** supporting horizontal and vertical scaling
- **Plugin System** for extensible functionality
- **Comprehensive Monitoring** and health checking
- **Backup and Recovery** mechanisms
