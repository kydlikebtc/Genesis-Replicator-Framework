# Genesis Replicator Framework

A modular framework for developing autonomous AI agents in Web3 environments.

## Overview

The Genesis Replicator Framework provides a robust foundation for building, deploying, and managing autonomous AI agents that can interact with blockchain networks and Web3 services. The framework is designed with modularity and extensibility in mind, allowing developers to easily create custom agents while leveraging common infrastructure components.

## Architecture

The framework follows a layered architecture:

1. Foundation Services Layer
   - Event System
   - Blockchain Integration
   - Data Storage
   - Configuration Management

2. Core Module Layer
   - Agent Core
   - Decision Engine
   - AI Module
   - Task Management

3. Integration Layer
   - Protocol Adapters
   - External Services
   - API Gateway

4. Agent Layer
   - Agent Implementation
   - Behavior Models
   - State Management

5. Orchestration Layer
   - Agent Coordination
   - Resource Management
   - Monitoring

6. Interface Layer
   - CLI
   - Web Interface
   - API Endpoints
