# Async Operations Guide

## Introduction
This guide provides detailed information about implementing and using the async operations features in the Genesis Replicator Framework. It covers connection pooling, concurrency controls, and best practices for async operations.

## Connection Pooling

### Overview
Connection pooling optimizes resource usage by reusing connections instead of creating new ones for each operation. The framework implements this through the `ConnectionPool` class.

### Implementation
1. **Pool Configuration**
   ```python
   from genesis_replicator.foundation_services.blockchain_integration import ChainManager

   # Configure pool size based on system resources
   manager = ChainManager(max_connections=10)
   await manager.start()
   ```

2. **Connection Management**
   ```python
   # Connections are automatically pooled
   await manager.connect_to_chain(
       chain_id="eth_mainnet",
       endpoint="https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR-PROJECT-ID",
       credentials={"api_key": "your_key"}
   )

   # Reuse connection from pool
   connection = await manager.get_connection("eth_mainnet")
   ```

### Best Practices
- Set appropriate pool sizes based on available system resources
- Implement proper connection cleanup
- Monitor pool utilization
- Handle pool exhaustion gracefully

## Concurrency Controls

### Overview
The framework provides mechanisms to control concurrent operations and prevent resource exhaustion.

### Implementation
1. **Parallel Operations**
   ```python
   async def process_multiple_chains():
       tasks = []
       for chain_id, endpoint in chains.items():
           tasks.append(manager.connect_to_chain(
               chain_id, endpoint, credentials
           ))
       results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
   ```

2. **Rate Limiting**
   ```python
   from genesis_replicator.foundation_services.blockchain_integration import RateLimiter

   limiter = RateLimiter(max_rate=100, time_window=60)
   async with limiter:
       await perform_chain_operation()
   ```

### Best Practices
- Use `asyncio.gather()` for parallel operations
- Implement proper error handling for concurrent tasks
- Monitor system resources during parallel operations
- Use rate limiting for external API calls

## Error Handling

### Overview
Proper error handling is crucial for async operations to maintain system stability.

### Implementation
1. **Timeout Handling**
   ```python
   try:
       async with asyncio.timeout(5.0):
           await manager.connect_to_chain(chain_id, endpoint, credentials)
   except asyncio.TimeoutError:
       logger.error("Connection attempt timed out")
   ```

2. **Connection Errors**
   ```python
   try:
       await manager.get_connection(chain_id)
   except ChainConnectionError as e:
       logger.error(f"Connection error: {e}")
       # Implement retry logic or fallback
   ```

### Best Practices
- Set appropriate timeouts for operations
- Implement retry mechanisms for transient failures
- Log errors with sufficient context
- Handle cleanup after errors

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Overview
Monitor async operations to ensure optimal performance and resource usage.

### Implementation
1. **Pool Metrics**
   ```python
   # Monitor pool utilization
   metrics = await manager.get_pool_metrics()
   if metrics['pool_utilization'] > 80:
       logger.warning("High pool utilization")
   ```

2. **Performance Tracking**
   ```python
   async def track_operation_performance():
       start_time = time.time()
       try:
           await perform_operation()
       finally:
           duration = time.time() - start_time
           metrics_collector.record_duration(duration)
   ```

### Best Practices
- Monitor connection pool utilization
- Track operation durations
- Set up alerts for resource exhaustion
- Collect error rate metrics

## Security Considerations

### Overview
Secure async operations implementation is crucial for system integrity.

### Implementation
1. **Credential Validation**
   ```python
   from genesis_replicator.security import validate_credentials

   async def secure_connect(chain_id: str, credentials: Dict):
       if not await validate_credentials(credentials):
           raise SecurityError("Invalid credentials")
       await manager.connect_to_chain(chain_id, endpoint, credentials)
   ```

2. **Rate Limiting**
   ```python
   from genesis_replicator.security import RateLimiter

   # Protect against DoS
   rate_limiter = RateLimiter(max_requests=100, window_seconds=60)
   await rate_limiter.check_rate_limit(client_id)
   ```

### Best Practices
- Validate all input parameters
- Implement rate limiting
- Use secure connection parameters
- Monitor for suspicious patterns

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Pool Exhaustion**
   - Symptom: TimeoutError when getting connections
   - Solution: Increase pool size or implement request queuing

2. **Memory Leaks**
   - Symptom: Increasing memory usage
   - Solution: Ensure proper connection cleanup

3. **Slow Operations**
   - Symptom: High latency
   - Solution: Check network conditions, implement caching

### Debugging
```python
# Enable debug logging
import logging
logging.getLogger('genesis_replicator').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

# Monitor connection lifecycle
async def debug_connection():
    try:
        connection = await manager.get_connection(chain_id)
        logger.debug(f"Got connection: {connection.id}")
    finally:
        await connection.close()
        logger.debug("Connection closed")
```
