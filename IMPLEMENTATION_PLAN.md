1. Event System Implementation:
   - [ ] event_router.py: Basic event routing and subscription
   - [ ] filter_chain.py: Event filtering system
   - [ ] priority_queue.py: Event prioritization
   - [ ] retry_manager.py: Error handling and retries

2. Blockchain Integration:
   - [ ] chain_manager.py: Multi-chain support
   - [ ] contract_manager.py: Smart contract interactions
   - [ ] transaction_manager.py: Transaction handling
   - [ ] sync_manager.py: State synchronization

## Phase 2: Core Agent Components

### 2.1 Enhanced Agent Core
Priority: High (Central coordination unit)

1. Basic Agent Management:
   - [ ] lifecycle_manager.py: Agent lifecycle control
   - [ ] memory_manager.py: Memory systems
   - [ ] resource_monitor.py: Resource tracking
   - [ ] agent_communicator.py: Inter-agent communication

### 2.2 Decision Engine
Priority: Medium-High

1. Decision Making Components:
   - [ ] strategy_manager.py: Strategy handling
   - [ ] rule_engine.py: Rule processing
   - [ ] priority_manager.py: Task prioritization
   - [ ] history_analyzer.py: Historical analysis

## Phase 3: AI Module Implementation

### 3.1 Enhanced AI Module
Priority: Medium

1. AI Components:
   - [ ] model_registry.py: Model management
   - [ ] training_manager.py: Training coordination
   - [ ] prediction_optimizer.py: Inference optimization
   - [ ] model_evaluator.py: Performance evaluation

## Phase 4: Application Layer

### 4.1 External Interfaces
Priority: Medium-Low (Depends on core functionality)

1. Interface Components:
   - [ ] client_sdk.py: SDK implementation
   - [ ] api_gateway.py: API management
   - [ ] admin_interface.py: Admin controls

## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Standards
1. Code Quality:
   - Use type hints throughout
   - Follow PEP 8 guidelines
   - Write comprehensive docstrings
   - Include unit tests for all components

2. Testing Strategy:
   - Unit tests for individual components
   - Integration tests for component interactions
   - End-to-end tests for complete workflows

3. Documentation:
   - API documentation for each module
   - Usage examples and tutorials
   - Architecture documentation updates

### Dependencies Between Components

1. Core Dependencies:
   - Event System -> All other components
   - Agent Core -> Decision Engine, AI Module
   - Blockchain Integration -> Event System

2. Secondary Dependencies:
   - Decision Engine -> AI Module
   - Application Layer -> All other components

## Timeline Estimates

1. Phase 1: 2-3 weeks
   - Project setup: 2-3 days
   - Foundation services: 1.5-2 weeks

2. Phase 2: 2-3 weeks
   - Agent core: 1-1.5 weeks
   - Decision engine: 1-1.5 weeks

3. Phase 3: 1-2 weeks
   - AI module implementation

4. Phase 4: 1-2 weeks
   - Application layer implementation

Total Estimated Time: 6-10 weeks

## Success Criteria

1. Functionality:
   - All components implement specified interfaces
   - Components interact according to architecture
   - Event system handles all communication

2. Performance:
   - Event system handles high throughput
   - Memory management is efficient
   - AI module provides optimized predictions

3. Reliability:
   - Error handling in all components
   - Retry mechanisms for failures
   - State consistency maintained

4. Security:
   - Authentication implemented
   - Authorization controls
   - Secure communication

## Next Steps

1. Begin with Phase 1:
   - Complete project structure setup
   - Implement event system core
   - Start blockchain integration

2. Regular Reviews:
   - Code review after each component
   - Architecture review after each phase
   - Performance testing throughout

This plan will be updated as implementation progresses and requirements evolve.
